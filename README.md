# Moon Diary

## About

For some time, I have been interested in understandind the physical and mental impact of the phases of the moon on us. This project serves as a simple daily diary to document these impacts.

## Structure

This is a monorepo containing both front-end and back-end of the projects in appropriately named directories. The front-end uses the React.js. The back-end is written in Node.js.

## Scope

I have just inititialized the project. However, the scope involves the following.

### front-end

- [ ] Simple user authentication.
- [ ] Display the details about the current phase of the moon.
- [ ] Basic text editor.
- [ ] Display past records.
- [ ] Set up a daily survey with standard question. { Structured for inference later | Allows entry without forcing the user to write.}

- [ ] Display metrics? patters? corelations?. Quantized information about the impact of the phases of the moon.

### back-end

- [ ] Create a schema for the databse.
- [ ] Simple user authentication.
- [ ] Allow creation of new entries.
